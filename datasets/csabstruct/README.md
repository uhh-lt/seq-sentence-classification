## What is CSAbstruct

CSAbstruct is a dataset of annotated computer science abstracts with sentence labels according to their rhetorical roles.
CSAbstruct is collected from the Semantic Scholar corpus.
Each sentence is annotated by 5 workers, with one of 5 categories {BACKGROUND, OBJECTIVE, METHOD, RESULT, OTHER}

## Statistics

Label % in Dataset
BACKGROUND 33%
METHOD 32%
RESULT 21%
OBJECTIVE 12%
OTHER 03%

Statistic Avg ± std
Doc length in sentences 6.7 ± 1.99
Sentence length in words 21.8 ± 10.0

## Labels

The label definitions are written by us.
Their paper does not provide any further definitions of the labels.
We use the same definitions in pubmed200k and csabstruct.

```
label_dict = {
    "background": "Provides context or previous knowledge relevant to the research topic. Think of it as setting the stage for the study.",
    "method": "Describes the procedures and techniques used in the research. This includes the study design, data collection, and analysis methods.",
    "objective": "States the main goal or purpose of the research. What question is this work trying to answer?",
    "result": "Presents the findings or outcomes of the research. This often includes statistical data, tables, and figures.",
    "other": "Any sentence that doesn't fit into the above categories. This could be discussion, analysis, limitations, or concluding remarks.",
}
```

{'background', 'objective', 'method', 'result', 'other'}
