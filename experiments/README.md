# Experiments

This folder contains all code do run the experiments. In this project, we ran various kinds of experiments:

- zero- and few-shot prompting evaluation of LLMs (sentence_llm_evaluator.py)
- training & evaluation of sequential sentence tagging models (tagger_experiment.py)
- training & evaluation of sentence classification models (sent_class_experiment.py, setfit_experiment.py)

For every dataset, we store some details (e.g. prompts, labels and their descriptions) in the corresponding folder. Results (report.csv) are also stored there.
